# authguidance.websample3
An OAuth 2 code sample consisting of a Web UI and an API that interact with an Authorization Server

This extends the second sample to include session management, logout and id tokens

See my blog at http://authguidance.com for further details

TODO- checkin after each:
1. Understand webpack and tsconfig options better, add comments and improve old samples if needed

2. Basics working - with npm start to rebuild + test on IE - then checkin and merge
   
3. Members with underscore / Arg return types / Public and private - check in

4. Async await / Error catching or SPA side

5. API side
