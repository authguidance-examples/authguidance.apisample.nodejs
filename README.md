# authguidance.websample3
An OAuth 2 code sample consisting of a Web UI and an API that interact with an Authorization Server

This extends the second sample to include session management, logout and id tokens

See my blog at http://authguidance.com for further details

WORK TO DO.
2. API and async / await
3. SPA to build type script in same way as API
4. Error catching to improve if possible
5. Use of args in logger classes may need improving
6. Should I build API to a bundle?
7. Classes to encapsulate web server and API operations
